# board-game
A try to give a little overview of my played games
this first try is to make our manually unsortable document public (accessible from anywhere)

I know:
	coding is not nice
	it will get better

Working:
	add played games
	list of games

pending / todo:
	edit games
	edit sessions
	delete sessions
	delete games
	add groups
	add better "who won"
	filter for own sessions, which were played by user only
	enable users to chose their own colors
